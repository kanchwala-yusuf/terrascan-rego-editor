## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install the extension from the [VS code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=accuricsinc.terrascan-rego-editor)
2. Open an IaC template on VS Code.
3. Highlight an IaC resource, right-click, and select `RegoEditor: Generate Config`.
4. Select the IaC engine this template uses (e.g. terraform, cft, k8s, etc.). This generates a normalized JSON file including the highlighted resource and its parameters.
5. Right-click the normalized JSON file and select `RegoEditor:  Generate Rego`. This creates a rule JSON and a Rego file.
6. Update relevant fields on the Rule JSON file according to your policy.
7. Update the Rego file to enforce your policy.
8. Right-click the Rego file and click on `RegoEditor: Scan` to test your policy.

This extension supports multiple configuration options. To view the settings, open the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` for Windows or `CMD + Shift + P` on Mac OS) and search for `RegoEditor: Configuration`.

From the configuration menu you should be able to customize:
- The counter suffixed to policies
- The default cloud provider
- Whether to show the helper text on newly created Rego files
- Credentials for syncing policies with [Accurics](https://accurics.com)
